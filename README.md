### What even is Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy?
It's a laboratory analytic technique that uses a circular dichroism spectrometer to measure the difference between left circularly polarized light and right circularly polarized light in a sample. It's commonly used to find the secondary structure of molecule and other parameters about a sample. You can find more information about it at: Chemistry Libretexts or you could look for official documentation from JASKO, which is the producer of the equipment we use in our lab.

Undergrads who are working on multi-hour lab sessions may not know if their data is correct or not. This tool help students see common errors with concentration, integration time, cuvette size. The voltage chart on the right is a supplement to the data, letting people know where data may or may not be faulty. Detailed instructions will be embedded in this page in the future.

### How was this made?
The data visualization uses Chart.js to create the CD and voltage graphs. The button logic is just raw Javascript while the CSS formatting comes from this open source project. Material Design Lite is used for the button styling.

As per the original license, this project is also licensed under the Apache License. Feel free to use any of the chart data or visualization logic for derivative works.

### Credits
This site was built by Kaiwen Wang part time over the Spring 2022 semester as part of a collaboration with Georgia Tech's Center for Teaching and Learning.

A big thanks goes to Dr. Mary Peek and Dr. Dexter Dean of Georgia Tech's chemistry department for their help in explaining the theory behind this technique and collecting the data used for this visualization and Dr. Vincent Spezzo as the department manager for CTL.
